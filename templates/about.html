                What is Phishing?

                Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to learn sensitive information such as login
                credentials or account information by sending as a reputable entity or person in email or other
                communication channels.<br />
                Typically a victim receives a message that appears to have been sent by a known contact or
                organization. The message contains malicious software targeting the userâ€™s computer or has links to
                direct victims to malicious websites in order to trick them into divulging personal and financial
                information, such as passwords, account IDs or credit card details.

                The main reason is the lack of awareness of users.Many users unwittingly click phishing domains
                every day and every hour. The attackers are targeting both the users and the companies. According to
                the 3rd Microsoft Computing Safer Index Report, released in February 2014, the annual worldwide
                impact of phishing could be very high as $5 billion.<br />
                But security defenders must take precautions to prevent users from confronting these harmful sites.
                Preventing these huge costs can start with making people conscious in addition to building strong
                security mechanisms which are able to detect and prevent phishing domains from reaching the user.
